# wheel-of-randomness
This is a passion project, maybe it will be a buggy roulette or maybe it works but anyways the feature will be listed on below.
The institution I working on right now wants me to create a roulette that will facilitate an unbiased roulette that will give the participants a random item from the roulette.

## Features
- [ ] Create a roulette that picks random item from an array.
- [ ] Create a lineup that will be populated with the with the picked item from the roulette.
- [ ] The picked item will be removed from the list and will be listed on the lineup.
